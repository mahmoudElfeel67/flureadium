# Plugin: flureadium

A Flutter wrapper for the Readium toolkits for ebooks, audiobooks and comics (kotlin-toolkit & swift-toolkit).
This project is a fork of [Notalib/flureadium](https://github.com/Notalib/flureadium)

This branch is under active development and meant to replace the `nota-lyt4` branch,
which implements both TTS and Text+Audio sync on top of the native toolkits via other Flutter plugins.

This plugin is supposed to support both EPUB and WebPubs, with or without pre-recorded audio.

## Plans

We will work on the main branch on a modernized and simple API using newest toolkits and utilize much more of the toolkit functionality.

See repo Issues for up-to-date progress.

General TODO:

- [x] Use Preferences API on both platforms.
- [x] Use Decorator API for highlighting.
- [x] Test TTS and Audio navigators for maturity, possibly replacing our own audio handlers.
- [x] Simplified support for MediaOverlays. Assumptions: Continuous audio playlist /w 1 overlay file per mp3.
- [ ] Support for custom Decoration styles
- [ ] Full support for Sync Narration and Guided Navigation
- [x] PDF format detection and preferences API
- [x] PDF navigator implementation (Android)
- [x] PDF navigator implementation (iOS)
- [x] PDF Flutter widget layer integration
- [x] Epist migration to Flureadium PDF
- [ ] PDF manual testing (Android & iOS)

## Adding flureadium to your project

To use, add to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flureadium: ^x.y.z
```

Also, update your Android and iOS projects as follows:

### Android

- A minSdkVersion ≥ 24 in `android/app/build.gradle` is required.
- If your main activity extends `FlutterActivity`, change it to extend `FlutterFragmentActivity`
  instead. This fixes the `MainActivity cannot be cast to androidx.fragment.app.FragmentActivity`
  error.
- If using the `AudioService` for TTS, add to the `<manifest>` element of
  your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```html
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

### iOS

- Manually add the `pod` lines to your `ios/Podfile`:

```rb
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'PromiseKit', '~> 8.1'

  pod 'ReadiumShared', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumShared.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumInternal', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumInternal.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumStreamer', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumStreamer.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumNavigator', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumNavigator.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumOPDS', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumOPDS.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumAdapterGCDWebServer', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumAdapterGCDWebServer.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumZIPFoundation', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/podspecs/refs/heads/main/ReadiumZIPFoundation/3.0.1/ReadiumZIPFoundation.podspec'

  ...
end
```

- To allow the local streamer on 127.0.0.1 to work, manually add to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```html
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true />
</dict>
```

### Web

To use this plugin for web, follow these steps to ensure everything works correctly:

#### 1. Copy the JavaScript File

To use the JavaScript file from the plugin in your Flutter web app, run the following command in your terminal from the root directory of your app:

```bash
dart run flureadium:copy_js_file <destination_directory>
```

It is recommended to place the destination directory within the `web` directory or a subdirectory of it. Avoid saving it outside the `web` directory.

#### 2. Add Scripts to `index.html`

After copying the JavaScript file to your app, add Flutter's initialization JS code and the plugin JS to the `head` section of your `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- Flutter initialization JS code -->
<script src="flutter.js" defer></script>

<!-- Plugin JS code -->
<script src="readiumReader.js" defer></script>
```

If the plugin's JS file is not saved in the same directory as `index.html`, update the source path accordingly.

# iOS Platform

iOS-specific setup and implementation details.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 14+
- CocoaPods

## Setup

### 1. Podfile Configuration

Add Readium pods to `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'

target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!

  # PromiseKit dependency
  pod 'PromiseKit', '~> 8.1'

  # Readium toolkit pods (version 3.5.0)
  pod 'ReadiumShared', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumShared.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumInternal', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumInternal.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumStreamer', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumStreamer.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumNavigator', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumNavigator.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumOPDS', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumOPDS.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumAdapterGCDWebServer', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.5.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumAdapterGCDWebServer.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumZIPFoundation', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/podspecs/refs/heads/main/ReadiumZIPFoundation/3.0.1/ReadiumZIPFoundation.podspec'

  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end
```

Then run:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

### 2. App Transport Security

Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist` for local content server:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

**Why?** Readium uses a local web server to serve EPUB content.

### 3. Background Audio (Optional)

For audiobook background playback, add to `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Implementation Details

### Plugin Structure

```

├── FlureadiumPlugin.swift       # Plugin registration
├── MethodCallHandler.swift      # Method channel handler
├── ReadiumManager.swift         # Readium lifecycle
├── ReadiumReaderViewFactory.swift # Platform view factory
├── ReadiumReaderView.swift      # Native reader view
└── NavigatorController.swift    # Navigation handling
```

### Platform View

Uses `UiKitView` for embedding UIKit views:

```swift
class ReadiumReaderViewFactory: NSObject, FlutterPlatformViewFactory {
    func create(
        withFrame frame: CGRect,
        viewIdentifier viewId: Int64,
        arguments args: Any?
    ) -> FlutterPlatformView {
        return ReadiumReaderView(
            frame: frame,
            viewIdentifier: viewId,
            arguments: args,
            messenger: messenger
        )
    }
}
```

### Readium Integration

Uses Readium Swift Toolkit 3.5.0:
- `Streamer` for EPUB parsing
- `EPUBNavigatorViewController` for content display
- `AVSpeechSynthesizer` for TTS
- `AVPlayer` for audio

### Local Server

Uses GCDWebServer to serve EPUB resources:
- Runs on localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Requires NSAppTransportSecurity exception
- Automatically starts/stops with publication

### Edge Tap and Swipe Navigation

The flureadium iOS plugin supports both edge tap and swipe gesture navigation for EPUB and PDF readers.

**How It Works:**

The `EdgeTapInterceptView` is a transparent UIView overlay that:
- Intercepts single taps on the left/right edges of the screen → triggers `goLeft()` / `goRight()`
- Intercepts swipe left/right gestures → triggers `goRight()` / `goLeft()`
- Passes through all other touches to the underlying reader view

**Note:** In EPUB scroll mode, both gestures are automatically disabled regardless of configuration.

**Configuring from Dart:**

Navigation behavior is configured via `setNavigationConfig()`, which is separate from Readium reading preferences:

```dart
// EPUB: disable edge taps but keep swipes
await flureadium.setNavigationConfig(
  ReaderNavigationConfig(
    enableEdgeTapNavigation: false,
    enableSwipeNavigation: true,
  ),
);

// PDF: wider tap zones
await flureadium.setNavigationConfig(
  ReaderNavigationConfig(
    enableEdgeTapNavigation: true,
    edgeTapAreaPoints: 80,
  ),
);
```

Both default to enabled (`true`) when not set. The `edgeTapAreaPoints` value is in absolute iOS points (44–120, clamped automatically) and defaults to 44pt (iOS HIG minimum tap target).

**iOS 26 touch routing — `interceptEdgeTaps`:**

On iOS 26+, Flutter changed how platform view touches are routed. Edge-zone touches now fall through `EdgeTapInterceptView` to the underlying WKWebView when there are no intercept callbacks set, which lets Readium's `DirectionalNavigationAdapter` see those touches — even when edge tap navigation is turned off.

To fix this, `EdgeTapInterceptView` has an `interceptEdgeTaps: Bool` property (default `false`) that is independent of callback presence:

- **EPUB paginated mode** — `interceptEdgeTaps = true` always. The view absorbs all edge-zone touches regardless of whether callbacks are configured. `DirectionalNavigationAdapter` never sees them.
- **EPUB scroll mode** — `interceptEdgeTaps = false`. WKWebView receives all touches natively for scrolling.
- **PDF reader** — `interceptEdgeTaps = enableEdgeTapNavigation`. PDF has no scroll mode on this path, so the view only intercepts when the feature is on.

This is a native iOS layer change only. No Dart or Flutter changes are required.

**Files:**
- `EdgeTapInterceptView.swift` - Shared edge tap and swipe detection view
- `ReadiumReaderView.swift` - EPUB reader using EdgeTapInterceptView
- `PdfReaderView.swift` - PDF reader using EdgeTapInterceptView

### Stream and View Lifecycle

Flureadium iOS uses `EventStreamHandler` to manage Flutter EventChannel streams (text locator, reader status, errors). Proper lifecycle management is critical:

- **Stream disposal** (sending `FlutterEndOfEventStream` and clearing handlers) must happen in the `"dispose"` method call from Dart, while the Flutter engine is still alive
- **`deinit`** only nils out references as a safety net — it must NOT send messages on Flutter channels, as `deinit` may be triggered during engine teardown when channels are no longer valid

This separation prevents crashes during app termination, where `FlutterEngine.destroyContext` triggers deallocation of native views after the message channels are already torn down.

### Global Reference Lifecycle

The plugin tracks the active reader view via two module-level globals in `FlureadiumPlugin.swift`:

```swift
internal weak var currentReaderView: ReadiumReaderView?
internal weak var currentPdfReaderView: PdfReaderView?
```

Both are `weak var` — they do not own the view. This mirrors Android's `WeakReference<ReadiumReaderWidget>` pattern in `ReadiumReader.kt`. The weak reference prevents a Swift runtime exclusivity violation that would otherwise occur during hot reload: when a new view's `init` assigns itself to the global, ARC releases the old value, triggering the old view's `deinit` — if `deinit` also writes to the same global, Swift detects overlapping exclusive writes and aborts.

Cleanup responsibilities:

| Event | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| `init` | View assigns itself to the global (`currentReaderView = self`) |
| `"dispose"` method call | Identity-guarded cleanup (`if currentReaderView === self { currentReaderView = nil }`) — prevents clearing a newer view that replaced this one during hot reload |
| `closePublication()` | Nils both globals before closing the publication — correct teardown order since views reference the publication |
| `deinit` | Does not touch globals — handles only the view's own resource cleanup |

The identity guard in the dispose handler matches Android's pattern at `ReadiumReaderWidget.kt:79`.

**Files:**
- `EventStreamHandler.swift` - Stream handler with `dispose()` that sends `FlutterEndOfEventStream`
- `FlureadiumPlugin.swift` - Global weak references and `closePublication()` cleanup
- `ReadiumReaderView.swift` - EPUB reader: init assigns global, dispose handler clears it
- `PdfReaderView.swift` - PDF reader: same pattern as EPUB

## Troubleshooting

### Pod Install Fails

```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod cache clean --all
pod repo update
pod install
```

### "No such module" Error

Clean build and reinstall:
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods
rm Podfile.lock
pod install
flutter clean
flutter build ios
```

### Localhost Connection Refused

Ensure NSAppTransportSecurity is configured in Info.plist.

### TTS Voice Quality

iOS provides high-quality voices. To check available voices:
```dart
final voices = await flureadium.ttsGetAvailableVoices();
// Look for "Enhanced" or "Premium" voices
```

### Memory Warnings

Close publication when not in use:
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  flureadium.closePublication();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Privacy Manifest
